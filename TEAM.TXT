Team Functions

Team::setScore(TeamId, ScoreString, SortValue) 
TeamId: Team number.  Each team is associated with a number 
            range from -1 to 7.  Where -1 is the observer team. 
ScoreString: The string that will be displayed. 
SortValue: The value ScoreStrings will be sorted by.
USED IN: Objectives.cs 
RETURN: True if succeed or False if failed.  
Used to set the team score values on the TAB screen. Look at the function ObjectiveMission::refreshTeamScores() in the Objectives.cs file.  I'll explain this function below:
          Team::setScore(%i, "%t\t " @ $teamScore[%i], $teamScore[%i]); 
          %i is the TeamNumber.  The "%t\t ": %t will print the teams 
          name and the \t will tab over to the next column (which is 
          defined in the setTeamScoreHeading function call).  The 
          $teamScore[%i] is the %i teams score and the last 
          $teamScore[%i] says that you want it to be sorted by 
          team score.  Sorts highest value on top lowest on the bottom. 

setTeamScoreHeading(HString) 
HString: The heading for the team scores on the tab screen. 
USED IN: Dm.cs, Objectives.cs 
RETURN: True if succeed or False if failed.  
Sets the heading for the team score section of the tab screen. For Example: 
          setTeamScoreHeading("Team Name\t\xD6Score"); 
          It will print Team Name and then move D6hex units 
          to the right and print Score.  The D6 is a hex value from 
          0 to FF.. 

Team::setObjective(TeamId, LineNum, String) 
TeamId: Team number.  Each team is associated with a number range from -1 to 7.  Where -1 is the observer team. 
LineNum: The line number to display the text on. 
String: The text string to be displayed.
USED IN: Dm.cs, Objectives.cs 
RETURN: 0  
Used to place text on the objective screen.  Each objective screen is team based. This allows you to have a different objective screen for each team.  It uses the TeamId to define on which objective screen to place the text. 

Team::clearObjectives(TeamId) 
TeamId: Team number.  Each team is associated with a number range from -1 to 7.  Where -1 is the observer team.
USED IN: Currently not used in any script files. 
RETURN: 0  
This will clear the objective screen for the team defined by the TeamId.
